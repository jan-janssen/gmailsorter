# Preparation 
Before using `gmailsorter` you first have to sort your emails manually. This step is necessary for `gmailsorter` to 
learn your preferences. 

## Sort your emails
Tips for sorting emails can be found everywhere on the internet. 

## Backup and remove your previous email filters 
Having multiple filters sorting your emails at the same time can result in conflicts, therefore it is recommended to 
backup and remove all existing email filters

## Create one separate label as inbox for gmailsorter
As `gmailsorter` is only checking your emails once every five minutes, it is recommended to transfer all your emails to
a separate label for `gmailsorter` to sort them from there to other labels.
